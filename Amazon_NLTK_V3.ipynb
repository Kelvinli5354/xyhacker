You know the texture of the banana, especially those little slivers that come off the skin, is a little powdery after you\\'ve eaten for a while?  Take that texture, remove the banana flavor, mix it in water, and you\\'ve got this.  Or extremely watered down milk.

I'm glad I did. These were wonderful! They are sweet and refreshing and, for better or worse, have chunks of jelly-like aloe. Drinking one of these is definitely a little different and you have to get used to that strange, slippery sensation, but every flavor I tried was delicious and now I am hooked.

The book was very informative about raw diets but I found his products pricey and I didn't want to buy it online.One day in the Vitamin Shoppe, I came across this product and the store manager was telling me how he did a one month detox drinking only this product and as a result he was able to successfully come off medication for diabetes. I wanted to try it but the price for the gallon was so much for me but luckily Vitamin Shoppe sold individual packets for $4. I bought 5 for the week and I saw improvement in my skin fast. I've been struggling with acne for over 2 years and my boyfriend right away noticed my skin improving over just one week. I had bowel movements regularly and daily and not to mention my energy was high. One night after work, my coworkers and I went out to a hookah bar I was dancing ALL night and I wasn't even drinking lol I had so much energy and I felt great. The moment I ran out I was caught up in school, moving, and work I stopped taking it for about 2 weeks and my acne came back alongside with slight constipation (but I was taking iron pills). I knew immediately that this meal replacement was good because I noticed my body before and after taking it.About the taste: the original is a bit nasty but when you're full of energy and your digestive system is improving who cares about taste. I just bought the gallon yesterday and I bought the chocolate flavor. I couldn't taste the flavor with water but today I used organic milk and it tasted a lot better. I will use almond milk next time cause I like the taste better.In conclusion, I love this product it has done wonders for my body and I feel great knowing that every single ingredient in this meal replacement is organic and raw.\"], [\"This is a great price and very convenient to have delivered to our house.

As another reviewer mentioned the broccoli isn't worth mentioning in the meal, think miniscule and these are smaller.  Unfortunately the taste was just lacking.  The cheese sauce was way too sweet and there was no broccoli taste, which we love.  My kids would have preferred any other type of pasta than orzo (give us bow ties, macaroni, penne).  I've tried to feed them two other times the leftovers to meet the same results.  Looks like leftovers are heading for the garbage can.

My husband wanted to buy them because I wanted to try the pouches for our son (6 months in a couple of days). He thought my notion that there was any difference between the brands was ridiculous. After I thought about it I decided he was right, fruit is fruit. Wrong! Some pouches contain just fruit (and/or veggies) these do not. These have concentrates and juice in them, so despite the small size they have more sugar and calories. I directly compared them to The Peter Rabbit ones (Apple & Banana) and the Peter ones are the same number of calories, have one gram less sugar, one gram more fiber, and are .14oz larger.I wish I read the box in the store. I haven't tried them and I may not bother, I think I'm going to return them. I gave them two stars because even with the extra sugar their small size makes them an acceptable dessert for an older child.

However, I attest to the fact that this is very good when I tweak the instructions.  If you mix it with seltzer water instead of tap water, it makes AMAZING soda.  For some reason, it doesn't taste as sugary when it's carbonated, so that solves the problem of it being too sweet for my tastes.  I'm sure that there are some purists out there who will say that it shouldn't be made into black currant soda, but I would highly recommend that it be made that way.\"], ['I have not yet seen a better value for cayenne pepper than this.

The cheese flavor is more subtle, and the oregano complements it nicely.Rosemary - This one has the least noticeable cheese flavor.  The rosemary is a tad strong for me, but not so strong that I dislike the crackers.* I suspect that redesigning the package insert tray would help.

This is not just Stevia- it has another raw sugar in it called cain sugar which gives 1.2g of sugar and 1.2g of total carbs and 5calories per serving- so be aware diabetics.Cane sugar (raw sugar) is sucrose which has been extracted from sugarcane, a tropical plant which produces naturally high concentrations of this sweet substance.No one will claim that sugar is good for you, but raw sugar is more healthful than refined sugar because there are no chemical additives. Raw sugar is minimally processed, making it a natural product and easier for your body to digest. All sugar is high in calories and low in2.Now the Sweetleaf in the packets has Inulin and Stevia Extract- the inulin which gives the fiber- so this has less than 1g of fiber- zero carbs zero sugar listed and zero calories per serving.Inulin is a polysaccharide that is produced by plants such as onions, leeks, Jerusalem artichokes, and garlic. It can also be referred to as neosugar, alant starch, Alantin, and diabetic sugar. Many manufacturers are putting it in processed foods because it has tremendous health benefits. It can also be used to replace higher calorie ingredients such as fat, sugar, and flour. However, there is also some controversy about how much it should be used.There are many ways that plants store energy for themselves, with inulin being one of them. As such, it can be found in the roots and rhizomes of many plants. When eaten, this substance does not increase blood sugar, which makes it an option for those with diabetes.There are many benefits of inulin. It has one-third to one-fourth less food energy than that of sugar and a sixth to a ninth less energy than fat. It is also a soluble fiber which means that when it passes through the body, it creates a gel. Since fiber is not digested in the human body, it passes through to the intestine largely intact. There, it feeds the good bacteria that live there. It also helps to reduce the absorption of bad cholesterol in the body.3.Stevia in the Raw has \"less than 1g of both sugar and carbs- ingredients are Dextrose and stevia leaf extract- however zero cal per servingDextrose is an organic compound.. It is manufactured naturally in the human body from the breakdown of mainly carbohydrates, but also proteins and fats. Dextrose is the result of photosynthesis in plants and is found in concentrated amounts in fruits and honey. This white, sweet, crystalline substance can be produced synthetically from starch. The names dextrose and glucose are often used interchangeably, but it is important to note the difference. Glucose has several molecular forms. Dextrose is the biologically active form and is very common in plant and animal life.Stevia is a word both for a plant and for a sweetener extracted from the leaves of that plant. stevia is much sweeter than other sugars, meaning that only a small amount needs to be used. The body also processes stevia very slowly, which greatly reduces the risk of a sugar high. it is essentially calorie free, which is why it is popular with dieters. it may be safe for diabetics, but diabetics should always consult their doctors about additions to their diet which may alter their blood sugar.'], ['This item is great.

Coconut oil may be associated with atherogenesis (disease affecting arterial blood vessels) so I choose to use for the topical benefits rather than ingesting it.I have learned from my boss who is form India, the secrets to her lovely shiny hair, and it's simply about warming up some coconut oil. I spoon it out if it's solid into a small glass bowl and microwaving for about 15 seconds then massaging my hair and scalp then tying a bun and letting it soak in for as long as I can ( anywhere between 15 minutes to hours or even overnight) then shampooing out with a clarifying or non moisturizing shampoo. Usually one shampoo is enough, sometimes if I have extra oil on the hair I shampoo again and then condition as usual.The sheen, bounce and manageability is incredible, I have never been as impressed with a product for the hair as with this simple treatment. The oil is inexpensive and lasts forever and the results are simply dazzling. For those with dry and fried hair, colored, tired or simply hair that needs a deep treatment this is heavenly. Even fine hair that has never been abused can benefit for it.I use this as often as I can, but once a week is sufficient, although the way the hair feels after is addictive and I can never wait to do it again.- Kasia S.\"], [\"Love this tea.

You can use it in on meats and vegetables or blended into unsalted butter with fresh rosemary.I have been told I'm not supposed to be using this salt in any of my cooking, but to use it as a finishing salt. I will agree it is best when sprinkled on food just before serving.

This salt looks a bit like tiny snowflakes and the flavor fills your entire mouth.Normal table salt will pale in comparison and almost has a chemical aftertaste in comparison to this highly prized salt. French chefs have known this secret forever and when I found this salt, I told everyone I knew about the flavor.Want to taste the best caramels ever? Look for Fleur de Sel Caramels.

I suppose my lack of enthusiasm for cooking comes from the fact that the effort in making any dish is soon demolished as the receipe involved is devoured either by other hungry people, or one\\'s self.  Nothing remains for all that work and effort!  John Fiedler, (I think), once told Julia Child that cooking and music are similar, in that after the effort is expended, the work soon disappears.  But Mr. Fiedler, (or perhaps John Williams -- or whoever else said this), was wrong.  Because music can be RECORDED -- and listened to over and over again.  Sadly, the same cannot be said for food.  You can make it over and over...but the effort involved is always the same.  Food cannot be \"recorded\", then \"played back\" in an instant.  Unless, I guess, you make a lot and freeze some of it.  But when the frozen portion is gone -- you\\'ve got to make the receipe all over again.Yes -- I AM a lazy cook.  A very, very, very, VERY lazy cook.  To me, making a tuna salad is an effort.  (Forget about anything more complicated to make!)  However, I will ALWAYS make the effort to make a tuna sandwhich, and take my own home-made \"liquid refresment\" with me, (ice tea, lemonade, iced coffee, etc.) -- \"brown-bagging\" whenever possible, to save a few pennies, which, day after day, and year after year, DO add up!Yes, even I will make tea.  With tea bags, (or even with lose tea), it is very, (VERY!) simple to make, after all!  (Even simpler than intant coffee....because, to make GOOD tea, the water should come just to boiling, whereas in instant coffee, the longer the water boils, the more tasty the instant coffee will be.Therefore, even I see absolutely NO reason to buy bottled tea!  OK -- maybe once, so that you can use the empty bottle(s) into which to pour your own, \"home-made\" tea, after the bottles are empty. All that is required is to rinse out the glass bottles, (IMMEDIATELY!) a few times, with very hot water, or put dish-detergent soap into the glass bottles, fill with water, leave overnight, and THEN rinse with very hot water.  Or put the empty glass bottles in the dishwasher to get them clean.  Not very hard -- even very lazy me can do these things.But, I suppose if you are going to get some bottles to put your tea in, you might as well get HONEST TEA COMMUNITY GREEN TEA, offered here on Amazon in a 12-bottle pack.  This tea is rated the No. 1 tea in one of a very famous series of diet -- or make that, non-diet -- books, (you know, the ones with all the pretty pictures in them).  Anyway, the authors of this book are very, er -- authoritative -- being editor-in-chief, and food and nutrition editors of some very well known, and famous, men\\'s and women\\'s health magazines.  HONEST TEA COMMUNITY GREEN TEA gets their highest marks.  I also note that there is a nice wide mouth and screw cap on this bottle -- easy for refilling and opening and closing, (keep a sterilized funnel handy, if needed).  This green tea has maltese oranges in it, (to sweeten the flavour and add to the health benefits), and is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union, and certified organic by the USDA.  It tastes pretty good for a green tea -- and the anti-oxidents in green tea have been proven to increase metabolism, and do other good things.  If you still don\\'t like the taste of green tea, you can, (after finishing this product), COMBINE green tea with other tea, (orange pekoe, English Breakfast, jasmine, etc.), for a better taste.  More cheaply -- with your own brewed tea from bags or lose-leaves.HONEST TEA COMMUNITY GREEN TEA comes in a 16 ounce bottle.  If you have a thermos of this size, (or larger), you might want to use it instead -- but this way, you will have many, (that is, 12!), eventually-empty bottles, and perhaps thus be able to fill, (and refrigerate), several at a time, thus saving yourself some extra work.

I think they taste good but not great and not as good as I would have expected after the rapturous descriptions of sea salt caramels I have heard from friends and family.  The packaging of this product left a lot to be desired.  They came in an attractive flat cardboard box, with the candies placed in a molded plastic tray inside.  However, there were four empty spots in the plastic tray.  Upon further investigation, it seems that there were not empty spots, but that the candies shifted around to one end of the tray, making it look partially empty.  Also, due to excessive jostling during shipping, the candies looked all beaten up and most of the sea salt had been knocked off.  I think what is needed here is a better molded plastic tray that minimizes movement of the candies during shipping.I contacted Amazon customer service and they gave me a 50% discount on my purchase price, which satisfied me.  After all, the candies were still edible.  I don't think Amazon can be held responsible for the damage.  The manufacturer should have packaged the product better.  However, given the shipping issues, and the fact that the candy was only good and not great, I'm not sure it is worth the price they are charging.\"], [\"I'm so glad this is available on Amazon!

The next day I took it out of the freezer (after they finally got hard) I put apple juice in it. I put the lid on it that has a hole on the top of it (by the way the hole is there to release the carbonation drinks). ( I had to use a finger to plug the hole so when I did shake it liquid would not get everywhere,which did NOT do any good cause it did anyway) So I am shaking the dang thing for two minutes now three minutes and by the time I made a mess with it, I gave up on shaking it. then I get to get a paper towel to wipe up the splashed juice that was everywhere.  I put it back in the box and I am returning it. That is my review. I dont recommend it. A blender  is much faster than to have to wait a whole night to freeze those little cubes!!The liquid did not slush up but it was really cold.

I love tea with most all kinds of foods, especially cornbread or country foods.  It also goes good with most all other ethnic foods.I usually drink my tea plain (no sugar).  Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.

It was humanity's type of wheat until about 2,500-3,000 years ago and may have been the common type used in some parts of the world until the 1600-1750 time frame.  Emmer Wheat is also a descendant which developed out of a hybrid with two other grasses around 3,000 years ago and became common in Egypt/middle east.Einkorn has very little of the gluten proteins found in modern wheat and so it may be a preferred alternative for those who are sensitive to the glutens in modern wheat. Warning - it is not gluten free.  Whether it is free of the &#34;toxic&#34; glutens (versus modern wheat) is a controversial subject and is largely unknown. My own opinion is that there is some truth to this, especially for those who have sensitivity.  Einkorn dough products are is slightly less glycemic than modern whole wheat (lower carbs), even more so than Emmer Wheat which is usually touted as being less glycemic bread.The glutens in Einkorn are not enough to hold together like regular wheat.  If you make a pizza dough with it as I do, I age/ferment it with yeast for a day or two, then you need to make the pizza on a thin flat pan.  The dough will not hold together for any handling like transferring it to a pizza stone.  Seems to be fine once baked however.Taste is like regular whole wheat, only slightly nuttier.Einkorn wheat is not as productive as modern developed wheat.  Modern developed wheat produces about 10x as much flour per acre, so you can see that Einkorn Wheat is always going to cost you more.I'm only aware of two farms in the U.S. which grow Einkorn wheat and market Einkorn flour.  Jovial seems to be a good one.  How lucky we are to live in the age when we can get such a specialized product by pointing and clicking at Amazon!  Maybe soon, Einkorn flour will be available commonly in places like Whole Foods, but for now, this is the only convenient way I know to get it.\"], ['Perfect condition - no broken pieces.

We have a Keurig Brewer at work and I used that for my hot water when making this (emptied packet into my mug and hit brew without putting in a K-cup).  I didn\\'t pay attention to the brew size and ended up making this with 10 oz of water instead of the recommended 8 oz, so my latte was watered down a bit, but it still had a good flavor and was foamy at the top.  The description of this product says \"Foam is so thick that a stir stick can stand on its own in the cup!\".  While my drink did get foamy, I can\\'t imagine it being that thick and foamy even if I had brewed it with the correct amount of water, but even for my watered down version it had a good amount of foam, so if made correctly it might be somewhat closer to that description, but I don\\'t think it would get all the way there.  This seemed to have less caramel flavor than what I\\'d get at my local coffee shop.  Obviously a little bit of that is my fault for adding too much water, but it seemed like even if it was made with the correct amount the caramel to coffee flavor would have been a little weaker than a typical caramel latte.  The caramel flavor is definitely there, it just may not be as strong as what you\\'re used to if you usually drink coffee shop lattes.Overall I\\'d say this is one of the best instant coffee drinks I\\'ve tried, but it is instant so you won\\'t get the full coffee shop quality and flavor.  I\\'ll be picking up some of this to keep in my desk at work for when I\\'m in the mood for a caramel latte instead of running to the coffee shop and paying a lot more.  I\\'m not sure I\\'d buy through Amazon though, the current price of $4.60 for a box ($0.57 per packet) seems a little high, I think I could probably find a better deal at my local grocery stores.'], ['I have been purchasing BumbleBars for several years.

It short: it has a premium taste without the premium price.We drink a lot of coffee at my house. Four to six cups in a morning and two more in the evenings. We wanted to knock back the caffeine without sacrificing taste. After switching to Eight O'clock brand, we would buy a bag of regular caff, a decaf and mix them in our container. Unfortunately, our local &#34;superstore&#34; grocery store became spotty about keeping the decaf blend on their shelves. That row was consistently sold-out.

It\\'s almost as good as an oatmeal raisin cookie, but much healthier.- \"Snack Factory Cinnamon Toast Pretzel Crisps\" (6 oz) are fantastic. I\\'m always a fan of pretzels and pretzel crisps, and this light, sugary flavor is no exception.

They have a light, salty flavor with an easy, non-sticky crunch.- The \"St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go Salad\" (6.2 oz) were a bit confusing at first. I immediately noticed wording that states \"Caution: Remove from pack completely prior to microwaving.\" Though on the front it states \"Ready to eat.\" Then, on another side, \"Top with cheese. Microwave (without sauce) to melt cheese.\" There is no cheese included, only sauce. Words and instructions are strewn about the entire package, making it impossible to figure out the intended way to eat. I tried it cold (unheated) without the sauce, as I\\'m not a fan of anything with vinegar, and it tasted fine. The presentation made it a bit unappetizing. The can contains diced carrots, sweetcorn, lentils, cannelini beans, onions, flageolet benas, and flavorings.- \"Emergen-C fizzy energy drink mix\" (4 packs, 0.3 oz each) is a powdered mix that is added to 6 ounces of water. My flavors were all Raspberry flavored fizzy drink mix. Each packet contains 1,000mg (1 gram) of Vitamin C. This just tasted bland and makes the water slightly carbonated. But it\\'s tolerable if you need a Vitamin C supplement.- The \"GoPicnic Peanut Butter + Crackers ready-to-eat meal\" (6.7oz) contains Peanut Butter & Co Natural Peanut Butter, Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers, Sweet Perry Orchards Unsweetened Applesauce, Annie\\'s Homegrown Cheddar Bunnies, and Surf Sweets Organic Gummy Bears.

No additives, preservatives....and even no extra sweeteners!  It isalso often regarded as a children\\'s beverage -- and to me, thatmeans the manufacturers have taken EXTRA care that the product isas good as can be.  After all, no manufacturer wants to be accusedof giving health problems, (now or in the future), or even out-right poisoning, children!  To me, a product specifically made forchildren, (and/or usually associated with children\\'s eating ordrinking it), is often, (but not always), an inexpensive way to getgourmet -- or almost gourmet -- quality food at a good price.I\\'ve had Juicey Juice before...and enjoyed it immensely.  But -- theJuicy Juice I have heretofore imbibed was the \"real McCoy\", (no, no-- NOT the Chief Medical Officer of the original Star Ship \\'Enter-prise\\' -- but \\'real McCoy\" as in the \"genuine article\".  THAT JuiceyJuice, (forget which flavour), came in a large BOTTLE, and had to beREFRIGERATED.  But wow....did it taste good!  : ),Yet, any bottled juice contains a LOT of water.  So -- why not buy theconcentrate, and add your OWN water?  It should cost less this way --why spend money on water you can get out of a tap for, (almost) free?(Excluding the ubiquitous water tax, in most instances.)  As Itrust only my own, home-made distilled water, buying the concentratedJuicey Juice seemed to make sense two ways -- if not three.  (1. Iused my own home-distilled water, 2.) Ounce for ounce, re-constitutedconcentrate HAS to cost less than juice in big bottles and 3.)  It leftmore room in my refrigerator....AND on my shelf.For this is not the usual FROZEN concentrate, you see.  It is \"un-frozenconcentrate.\"  That doesn\\'t need to take up valuable space in thefreezer -- or even the refrigerator, at least till it is opened. On topof all this, it is all-natural Juicey Juice.  How could I resist THISbargain?  How could I miss with it?Well -- as soon as I opened up a can, (admittedly fitted with a veryconvenient flip-top), diluted it as per instructions, and tasted it --I KNEW I had \"missed\".  And missed Big-Time.  The flavour was absolutelyAWFUL!  It tasted as if MEDICINE, on top of the WORST-tasting of CHEMICALS, including a LARGE dollop of MACHINE OIL!  I definitely believe it could send many crewmen TO Dr. McCoy\\'s sickbay on Star Trek.  It surely made ME feel sick!  I was also shocked and saddened.  In oomplete disbelief, I looked at the ingredient label again.  It said:Apple Juice ConcentrateWaterGrape Juice ConcentrateNatural FlavorsRaspberry Juice ConcentrateAscorbic Acid, (Vitamin C)Citric AcidNope -- nothing wrong with the ingredients.  No motor oil, either. Theingredients -- they were all natural, as always advertised.  And this is a juice usually served to CHILDREN!  Cofusionmixed with great disappointment filled my mind.  I began to wonderabout the poisons I have heard that occur naturally.  Poisoned mush-rooms, perhaps?  But no mushroom of any sort was listed amongst theingredients.....Were my taste-buds going into pre-mature old age, perhaps?  SOMETHINGhas to go first, according to the popular view.  NOBODY reaches 90without SOME loss of faculties -- or almost nobody, anyway, so most people suppose. I guess I\\'ve been lucky in meeting mostly youthfully-minded and spirited 90+ year-olds in my life. But not everyone is that way, even I must admit.  But YIKES....I\\'m nowhere NEAR 90. (yet, anyway.)I sighed.  Better my taste-buds go first, than my eyes, or my legs...I tried drinking it straight.  Then, more diluted than was called for.  Ulgh, and double ulgh.  Then with the proper 3 cans of water to one can of Juicy Juice dilution.  Ulgh!  No matter how I tried to make it, the flavor didn\\'t improve.  At all.... ):Still disbelieving, I looked again, this time VERY CAREFULLY at the label.  And I noticed something written there I hadn\\'t noticed before.T H I S....P R O D U C T....I S....P A S T E U R I Z E D..( ! )  Not even written in small lettering -- but this notice WAS below all the other information on the label....Pasteurized!  In common slang, \"nuked\". I suppose, being a NON-FROZENooncentrate, SOMETHING had to be done to the Juicey Juice to keep it fresh.  I\\'ve heard that Vitamin E makes a dandy preservative -- but it probably is MUCH more expensive than nuking -- excuse me, pasteurizing! -- the Juicey Juice.  I mean, pasteurization really doesn\\'t harm the juice, as far as health considerations go.  But -- it DOES make the juice taste like motor oil -- and USED motor oil at that!So, I guess I\\'ll go back to either regular bottled juice, (including bottled Juicey Juice), or FROZEN concenrate.  (As much as admire the tv series ALIEN NATION, with Tenctonese aliens who drink sour milk, eat newspapers, and adore cooking all kinds of bugs -- this unfrozen Juicy Juice concentrate is NOT to my (Human) taste.  Sorry.  Then again -- I wonder if even a fictional Tenctonese, (and former slave), could stomache this stuff either.  Motor oil is NOT something evem the Tenctonese imbibed on the show.......I wish the taste of Juicy Juice Non-Frozen concentrate could be changed.But I doubt whether even a pound of sugar in each 11.5 ounce can could help.  (Before buying this, I was disappointed to see an extra .5 ounce had been eliminated from the usual 12 ounce can.  But after drinking the stuff, I was immeasurably grateful it had been taken off!I knew I could not throw it out.  I had paid money for it, and I was not brought up to be wasteful.Yes, I knew I had bought this....this ....stuff...and the taste was....well, on a score of1-10, it was about a 3...so I knew I could, and would, finish all 12bottles of concentrate, for I was not brought up to waste things.However......no one was telling me I had to drink them quickly.  Painis sometimes better when it\\'s spread out.  Maybe....I could stretchthis stuff out, drinking a few ounces a week, to lessen the pain ofdrinking it all at once?  Maybe drinking it while watching my favourite cable channel -- the SyFy channel -- would lessen the blow....?  No, I suddenly thought -- drinking this horrible-tasting liquid whilst watching the SyFy channel, of all things, was definitely NOT a good idea.  Maybe....I could take it better watching a comedy?  A musical?  Or better yet, a musical comedy?  Then, THE perfect time to drink this this...juice...came to me.  The time when I felt not worse, not scared -- but at my best.  The day AFTER I file my income taxes!  And maybe on my birthday, and the 4th of July....when my happiness could, perahps, overwhelm the complete awfulness of the taste of this...this...stuff. Maybe I could pass it off on some friends, during a Halloween party?  No -- I like and value my friends to pass THIS stuff onto them.  Hmmm....maybe as a \"gift\", should I ever need to give one, to my ex-brother-in-law?  (This guy once told me: \"You are 6 years younger than I am, and I\\'ll never forgive you for it\", amongst other choice morsels.  He has always had a chip on his shoulder as big as the Grand Canyon.)  Hmmm...maybe not. If I give him THIS, that chip on his shoulder may get as big as a crater on the moon!...It\\'s amazing how GOOD regular, bottled Juicy Juice can taste -- and how totally awful this unfrozen concentrate is.  But at least I know the reason WHY now.  The old poem has it WRONG: \"Their\\'s was not to reason why, their\\'s was just to drink....er, do....or die.\"  I looked at the can, and I now KNOW why it tastes so BAD.  (The information about this concentrate being pasteurized is also on the Amazon description of it,but it is NOT highlighted, so it\\'s easy to pass by.)Well, live and learn.  Hey.............I\\'ve got it!  Instead of executing criminals, they should have to drink this stuff, at every meal, for a year.

There is no option to reduce it. :( So to be fair to the sellers, there's nothing they can do.The kefir goes through shock during shipping. Sending a few grains in a bit of milk will help it recover faster. Kefir needs sugar (the lactose in milk) to live. To send 1/4 cup of grains would require a lot of milk for the kefir to survive the shipping time. And within a couple of weeks you will have more kefir than you know what to do with.Also, for those needing some instructions, here is what I do:1) Strain kefir grains in fine metal mesh sieve (I got mine at Target). Some people say not to use metal, but after research (and my own experience), I have not found that it makes a difference.2) Rinse kefir grains with water. (Some people omit this - especially the first few times of making kefir. Not rinsing them will help them multiply more quickly.)3) Put kefir grains in a glass with one cup of milk (I use raw, but store-bought works great, too.).4) Cover with paper towel and secure with rubberband.5) Leave glass on counter for 2-3 days. Consistency ranges from curdled milk to yogurt and even separated. It's all good. The grains will take a few days to recover from shipping, but should take off after that.6) Repeat step one and use kefir for baking (instead of buttermilk), in smoothies, or however you'd like.7) After grains have doubled in size, you can use more milk or divide them and give them away.~If the kefir solidifies (like yogurt), use a spoon/spatula to push as much as possible through the sieve and then just rinse the rest out with water in the sink.~If you need to be gone or want to take a break from making kefir, do steps 1-4 and then put the glass in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.~Do not let the grains dry out. They will die. Do not leave the grains in kefir for too long (a week-ish). They will run out of sugar (lactose) and die.Here's a great site I have found helpful for making kefir:[...]\"], [\"We found these on vacation but couldn't find them we came home.

Of course, for 25 calories, I didn't expect it to be like that wonder cup of hot cocoa I got in New York after ice skating. (I'm afraid to ask how many calories were in that.) Using amount of water recommended in the directions, I enjoyed a small, warm cup of chocolate liquid. It didn't taste watery. I had no desire to add sweetener.The packaging could be better. When I took out the packets, I knew to separate the perforated packets carefully per lesson learned years ago. One of the perforations ripped sending cocoa powder on the floor making a mess. I like the packets -- as opposed to the scoop in powder kind -- because they provide portion control. But if they're going to rip that easily, I'll be wasting precious cocoa powder.There were a few clumps, but I find that goes away when the water isn't boiling hot. Warm up the water to just enough heat and the clumping will be reduced. For me, one minute in the microwave and fast stirring limited the clumping.For sugar / carb watchers, this has 4g of carbs, less than 1g of fiber and 2g of sugars. Not bad for getting a nice cup of hot chocolate. It also has 30% of the daily recommended calcium and 2g of protein. Another bonus.If you want, you can pump up the flavor without adding too many more calories. Try fat free whipped topping, unsweetened vanilla almond milk (only 30 calories in a cup) or sugar substitute. But it works great just adding water. It instantly warmed me up on the first cold day of the season.It's a tasty cup for 25 calories.

And you control how much  flavor to add without any sugar.When I was a kid, my mother would flavor milk with plain vanilla or almond to make it more palatable.  It's a good way to add a touch of flavor and sweet touch without sugar.I use real vanilla extract for baking and custards, but I am sure Mccormick brand imitation vanilla is fine for baking too, just use a little more to taste.  That's the cook's choice.When I make cocoa from real cocoa poweder, I use half the sugar and add this vanilla.

On the upside, there are only 100 calories per bar and while I refused to taste it, my taste-tester at home proclaimed it to be \"really good, crisp and chewy at the same time.\" Good, perhaps for those not concerned about ingredients and only calories, but not for my lifestyle.'], [\"This product is a fun gift or project for those who enjoy a little fruity booze and the feeling of do it yourselfing.  48 hours makes a nice bubbly and refreshing thing just be sure and pour about a glass out before as it bubbles up.

Some of the popcorn looks coated in caramel, but when you eat it, it's clear that those pieces are &#34;mistakes&#34; - they aren't sweet, but are still covered in whatever makes them crunchy. It's like biting into &#34;ice cream&#34; and getting mashed potatoes. So gross. There are some regular caramel pieces, but I really hated having to gamble on the flavor.

I would use these on a camping trip or hiking event but would not use on a daily basis.  The flavor was bland and I did not care for the texture which I found to be pastey.  Tended to stick to the roof of my mouth and was a little hard to swallow.  Did not get a distinct blueberry flavor. The most flavorful was when a bite would contain a nut.  The actual appearance of the bar is not appealing in the least.  I almost threw half of it away but then went ahead and forced the rest down.

It is an acquired taste, but it is wonderfully salty and addictive. I use it sparingly with all kinds of things. I'm hooked on it! Years ago, when one could transport items like The Gentlemen's Relish on board a plane, I used to purchase the product in a ceramic black jar with gold lettering at Gatwick airport, a jar of about 6 ounces, which are quite nice to use to store your treasures in after you've eaten the delicious treat within. Because it is salty, it's perfect to eat small amounts on cocktail crackers with sliced hard-boiled eggs, or with small bites of cheese.  Once you've acquired a taste for it, it's hard not to imagine adding a smidge to most any bite-size snack. I must credit The Two Fat Ladies' television show from years ago about introducing me to The Gentleman's Relish. Those ladies loved it, as I do now!\"], [\"I absolutely love this brand of tea.

When the wheat intolerance came along, I thought I'd never get to enjoy my occasional Mac fix again, but then I stumbled across this!

Mom always served this hot. She steamed it using a kettle with a steamer insert. No microwaves in common use then. Homemade brown bread is steamed in cans on a rack in a kettle on the stove. I made it with a mixture of whole wheat flour, rye flour, and cornmeal. So does B&M.; As others have noted, open both ends of the can and push it out. Or, if it is particularly stuck, use a knife around the edges to loosen it and push again. I like to butter a couple of slices on a plate and microwave them until the butter melts.
